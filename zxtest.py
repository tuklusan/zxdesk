"""Run a routine from a ZX Desk build headlessly and assert on memory.

The project instructions asked for this and it had not been built: a
harness that loads the binary, steps the CPU and checks the result,
rather than reading numbers off a screenshot. It does not replace the
Fuse run, because it models the CPU and not the video, has no ROM and
no interrupt source, so anything touching the character set, the tape
ROM routines or frame timing still has to go through Fuse.

What it is good for is the correctness subjects: the editor, the
storage layer and the keyboard decode are pure RAM and can be driven
here in a fraction of a second with a real assertion at the end.

    TEST=1 ./build.sh           assemble what this drives
    ./zxtest.py                 run every headless subject and assert

    This exists because the pointer would not move in Fuse and the
    cause was invisible from outside: ClampDelta discarded any delta
    at or beyond 25, on the grounds that a floating port produces
    large random swings. It does, and so does a mouse. The MOUSETEST
    build measured 68 in one frame on a real run, and everything from
    25 up was being thrown away in full, so the pointer moved if you
    crept and sat still if you moved it normally.

    The pair of reads that have to agree is the actual defence
    against a floating port. The clamp's job is to bound movement,
    not to reject it.

    This is A2's acceptance test and it is the whole reason A2 was

    does not delay the interrupt: the Spectrum asserts INT for 32 T
    and then withdraws it, so an interrupt refused inside that window
    never happens at all. Measured here before the rewrite, an
    injected interrupt was refused at 458 of 500 instruction
    boundaries in DevFillRect and 710 of 752 in DevFillDesk. The 42
    that survived in each were the setup before the DI.

    What makes the sweep worth having rather than an argument on
    paper is the second and third columns. SP walks through screen
    memory during a fill, so accepting an interrupt means the CPU
    pushes two bytes of return address into the display. The fill is
    built so those two bytes always land where they are about to be
